        <ol class="crepes-ordered-list-one">
          <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the egg whites, all-purpose flour, milk, and a pinch of salt. Whisk the ingredients together until you have a smooth batter. If desired, you can also add sugar or vanilla extract at this stage for sweet crepes.</li>
          <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with cooking spray or a small amount of butter.</li>
          <li>Pour a small amount of the batter into the hot pan, swirling it around to evenly coat the bottom. Use about 1/4 cup of batter for a 6-8 inch crepe.</li>
          <li>Cook the crepe for about 1-2 minutes, or until the edges start to lift slightly and the bottom is lightly golden. Use a spatula to carefully flip the crepe and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Transfer the cooked crepe to a plate and continue the process with the remaining batter. Stack the cooked crepes on top of each other as you go, keeping them warm by covering with a clean kitchen towel.</li>
          <li>Once all the crepes are cooked, you can fill them with your desired toppings or fillings. Sweet options include fresh fruits, whipped cream, Nutella, or jam, while savory options can include cheese, ham, or sautéed vegetables.</li>
          <li>Fold or roll the crepes with your chosen fillings and serve them warm.</li>
