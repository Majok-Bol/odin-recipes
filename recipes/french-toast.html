        <h3 class="french-toast-ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="french-toast-unordered-list">
          <li>
            Bread: Choose thick slices of bread such as brioche, challah, or
            French bread. Stale bread works best as it absorbs the egg mixture
            without becoming too soggy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eggs: Use large eggs as the base for the French toast batter. The
            number of eggs depends on the desired serving size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Milk or Cream: Adding milk or cream to the egg mixture helps create
            a rich and creamy texture. Use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of milk or cream
            per 2-3 eggs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vanilla Extract: Enhance the flavor of your French toast with a
            splash of vanilla extract. Use about 1 teaspoon for every 2-3 eggs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cinnamon: Sprinkle in a pinch of ground cinnamon to add warmth and
            aroma to the French toast. Use about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon per 2-3
            eggs, or adjust to your taste preference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Salt: Add a small pinch of salt to balance the sweetness and enhance
            the overall flavor.
          </li>

        <ol class="french-toast-ordered-list">
          <li>
            In a shallow bowl or pie dish, whisk together the eggs, milk or
            cream, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt until well
            combined. This mixture will be the batter for dipping the bread.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a small
            amount of butter or cooking spray to prevent sticking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take a slice of bread and dip it into the egg mixture, allowing both
            sides to soak for a few seconds until well coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the coated bread onto the preheated skillet or griddle. Repeat
            this step with additional slices of bread, making sure not to
            overcrowd the cooking surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the French toast for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden
            brown and cooked through. Adjust the heat if needed to prevent
            burning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the cooked French toast to a plate and continue cooking the
            remaining slices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the French toast warm with your choice of toppings.
            Traditional options include maple syrup, powdered sugar, fresh
            berries, or a dollop of whipped cream. Feel free to get creative
            with your favorite toppings.
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy your homemade French toast!</li>
