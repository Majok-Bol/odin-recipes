        <h3 class="french-toast-ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="french-toast-unordered-list">
          <li>
            Bread: Choose thick slices of bread such as brioche, challah, or
            French bread. Stale bread works best as it absorbs the egg mixture
            without becoming too soggy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eggs: Use large eggs as the base for the French toast batter. The
            number of eggs depends on the desired serving size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Milk or Cream: Adding milk or cream to the egg mixture helps create
            a rich and creamy texture. Use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of milk or cream
            per 2-3 eggs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vanilla Extract: Enhance the flavor of your French toast with a
            splash of vanilla extract. Use about 1 teaspoon for every 2-3 eggs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cinnamon: Sprinkle in a pinch of ground cinnamon to add warmth and
            aroma to the French toast. Use about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon per 2-3
            eggs, or adjust to your taste preference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Salt: Add a small pinch of salt to balance the sweetness and enhance
            the overall flavor.
