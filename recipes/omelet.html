          <ul class="order">
            <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup baby spinach leaves (washed and dried)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter or cooking oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>
              Optional toppings/fillings (such as cheese, diced tomatoes,
              mushrooms, onions, etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="steps">Steps</h4>
          <ol class="preparing">
            <li>
              In a medium-sized bowl, crack the 2-3 large eggs and whisk them
              together until well combined. You can season the eggs with a pinch
              of salt and pepper at this stage if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat a non-stick skillet or omelet pan over medium heat. Add the
              butter or cooking oil and allow it to melt and coat the bottom of
              the pan evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the butter has melted, add the baby spinach leaves to the
              pan. Sauté the spinach for about 1-2 minutes until it starts to
              wilt. You can season the spinach with a pinch of salt and pepper
              if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the whisked eggs over the sautéed spinach, ensuring that the
              eggs are evenly distributed in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the omelet cook undisturbed for a minute or so, allowing the
              edges to set.
            </li>
            <li>
              If using any optional toppings or fillings like cheese, diced
              tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, etc., now is the time to add them to
              one half of the omelet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using a spatula, gently fold the omelet in half, covering the
              toppings/fillings. Press down lightly to seal the omelet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook the omelet for another minute or two until the eggs are fully
              cooked and the toppings/fillings are heated through. You can
              adjust the cooking time based on how well-done you prefer your
              eggs.
            </li>
            <li>Carefully slide the omelet onto a plate and serve hot.</li>
            <li>
              You can garnish the omelet with additional fresh baby spinach
              leaves or any desired herbs before serving.
